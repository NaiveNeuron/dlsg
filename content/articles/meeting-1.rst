The topic of the first meetup of the revamped DLSG was (apart from a
long-ish administrative announcement) a quick and dirty introduction to
`Keras <https://keras.io>`_.

Presentation
============

The presentation used on this meetup, along with a list of references used
in its preparation can be found `here
<https://v9tgvr7zkle0k6wneymp.mrshu.sandcats.io/index.html#/>`_.

Supplementals
=============

The supplemental materials (namely the Jupyter notebook with a ton of Keras
examples) can be found in the DLSG `repository
<http://github.com/NaiveNeuron/dlsg/>`_ [#fn1]_. Many of the discussed
examples were more than inspired by the `STAT 655 course
<http://euler.stat.yale.edu/~tba3/stat665/>`_ from Yale which is definitely
worth taking a look at.


.. [#fn1] Note that the sentimet analysis demo expects the
          `Large Movie Review Dataset <http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/>`_
          to be extracted in the ``data`` folder.
