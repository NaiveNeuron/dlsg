This special pre-Christmas meetup was devoted to a quick review of the
`NIPS 2016 <https://nips.cc>`_ conference, which some of the regular
attendees of our meetups were lucky to experience.

News
====

We skipped this section in favor of doing a more in depth review of the
NIPS conference. The presentation (and the meetup as a whole) was full of
news anyway.
