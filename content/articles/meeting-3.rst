algorithms which are frequently used in the context of training of
Artificial Neural Networks.

Presentation
============

The presentation used on this meetup, along with a list of references used
in its preparation can be found `here <presentations/dlsg_3.pdf>`_.

Note that the presentation was in many ways inspired (sometimes a bit too
much) by `this article <http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/>`_.
