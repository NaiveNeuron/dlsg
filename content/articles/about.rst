The Deep Learning Study Group is a volunteer-organized meeting initiative. Its
irregular meetups usually revolve around (but are in no way limited to) Deep
Learning and related topics.

We normally meet in two week intervals in the `Pavilon of Informatics @
FMPH, UK <https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/>`_ and discuss various topics related
to Deep Learning, which are usually agreed upon in advance. These meetups
are usually held in very informal fashion and anyone interested is welcome
to join us. Future sessions as well as other news are announced on the
`maling list <http://lists.dai.fmph.uniba.sk/listinfo/dlsg/>`_.

This site contains reports from these meetups along with a ton of other
supplemental material.

Our friends at `FIIT, STU <http://www.fiit.stuba.sk/>`_ organize
`similar meetups <https://www.pewe.sk/datalys/readings/>`_ during the weeks
in which there are none happening at FMPH, UK.

Any comments, notes, suggestions and other feedback should be aimed at
`mrshu|AT|naiveneuron.com <mailto:mrshu|AT|naiveneuron.com>`_.
