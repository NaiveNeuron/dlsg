The focus of the second meetup were the basics of Artificial Neural
Networks, the mandatory (and therefore somewhat boring) introductions to
related fields and also principles on which many of the ideas discussed
later are built upon.

News
====

Starting this meetup, we decided to devote some time in the beginning of
our meetups to a discussions on 'news' in the Deep/Machine Learning world
that caught our attention since the last meeting.

The idea is that since the field of DL/ML is moving very fast, it is quite
easy to miss interesting gems that get released or published. The news
section is an open floor for anyone to come up and present anything at
least tangentially related to DL/ML that is "new" and could be of interest to
the whole group.

These "news" items will then be preserved and published as part of this
writeup.

Presentation
